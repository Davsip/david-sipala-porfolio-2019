I leverage research to design user-centered products and experiences which solve both user and business problems. My process is hands-on, collaborative, and iterative. Although I have a holistic view of user experience design, I am most focused on interaction design, user research, and usability testing. My goal is to design products and experiences that are meaningful and impactful, and I'm especially interested in utilizing new technologies to improve people's lives in innovative ways.</p>

                          <p> Planning the UX Research-Design was the first step for the project. Take the time to set up a detailed overview of your high-level research goals, team, budget, and timeframe that gave our research the best chance of succeeding. Making sure everyone working on the project is evident in the objectives and time frames. Determine the goal of the study. Determine the purpose of the research, the subjects, the tools, the logistics, the users we initially wanted to target. Identify the practical issues, evaluate, interpret, and present the data. Think in terms of questions we want answers, review, and interconnect topics.

Numerical data, provided great information, for example, how much time takes for each service on the different car wash business — the time on the waiting line for the service in some cases and driving to the car wash. Observation provided naturally occurring data; in-depth data were a great tool for the findings.  </p>

                    Both the process of making an empathy map and the finished artifact had essential benefits for the organization:
                    The empathy map was a quick, digestible way to illustrate user attitudes and behaviors. Once we created, acted as a source of truth throughout a project and protected it from bias or unfounded assumptions.
                    Uncovered user needs that the user may not even be aware of.
                    Understand what drives users’ behaviors and

              <p>I personally had the experience going to restaurants and seen surveys on the receipt, if 
                  you fill it out, you get a free reward. But it was too tedious to go to the website and do it. 
                  so the idea was to do an app that  combines all the restaurant and have a system to do 
                  surveys that are fast to do and easy to redeem. !</p>

            <h4 class="ttext-info mb-4">The idea represented on a Storyboard</h4>

              <p>The best way to start a project communicate an idea is with a storyboard. Stories are an effective and inexpensive way to capture, convey, and explore experiences in the design process. Storyboards put people at the heart of the design process. They put a human face on analytics data and research findings. Storyboarding is useful for participatory design. Participatory design involves all parties (stakeholders, UI and UX designers, developers, researchers) in the design process, to ensure that the result is as good as possible. With a compelling storyboard that shows how the solution addresses the problem, the product is more likely to be convincing to the target audience.</p>

                  <p>There are other apps that are capturing rewards and surveys. However, there is currently nothing that streamlines the process for restaurant owners and consumers, the way Chomp Change can. Plenti was funded by American Express and covered loyalty rewards for a multitude of unrelated businesses, such as Kroger and Exxon Mobile. It closed down after many of the larger partners pulled funding due to disappointing ROI. As we researched competitors in this arena, we found options like American Express’s now-defunct Plenti, Drop, Surveys on the Go, and many others that are capturing rewards and surveys. However, there is currently nothing that streamlines the process for restaurant owners and consumers, the way Chomp Change can. Plenti was funded by American Express and covered loyalty rewards for a multitude of unrelated businesses, such as Kroger and Exxon Mobile. Purchases at each business earned loyalty points that could then be redeemed at any partner, like Hulu and Lowes. It closed down after disappointing ROI.

                      <p>We did our research, with a few local restaurants that offer free items for taking a survey. Currently, after purchase, your receipt allows you to log in online, take a survey, and get a verification code that you have to write on your receipt physically, then save that receipt, remember to take it with you on your next visit, and redeem it, all within a typical 5 - 7 day window. Rarely does anyone do this, yet almost every company has a version of this printed on their receipts</p>

                          <p>As we began transitioning to wireframes, we used the Functional Group Worksheet to help understand the functions of the screens we are creating for the app. It helped users to focus on what elements should be primary, secondary, etc. It  helped us keep in mind the goal of the screen and the user's focus. We created a board in inVision were we could post our sketches and wireframes as we began developing them. We also created an inspiration board brand elements we liked and thought fit the app.

                             <p>Some flows, we had to drill down more than a few levels to get a better understanding of the task and how to simplify it. Part of the reason for that was because we were not sure how it would work. We researched by downloading similar apps and using some of our own experiences. We also kept in mind our goal to keep our app easy to use and what will be on each screen. With the guidance of our teachers, we went back to simplified the workflows by thinking about what we wanted the users to accomplish on a mobile app and what was necessary. 
                                We realized as a team that we needed to simplify our focus because we have a limited amount of time. We decided to focus on the primary functions of the app. For the consumer side, we focused on the existing user's login, taking a survey, and redeeming a reward. For the business side, our user was a Small-Midsize Restaurant owner as a current user; the workflows would be creating a survey and view their analytics.

                                       <p>Before we started developing our comps, we thought about what we wanted the first impression of our brand to be. During a Skype meeting, we came up with several adjectives. Exciting, fun, quick, rewarding.  We researched the meaning of color and decided on colors and then chose to use a san serif font because it’s easy to read. We landed on Montserrat a google font. We started to piece our style guide together using Adobe XD style guide template. We looked at other apps to get inspiration for our brand. We all came up with names for the app and posted them in Trello using a plugin we voted in Trello. There were a few variations of the logo we voted and landed on the one you see here. 

                                          (Problem Example: Colors, we looked up the color psychology,  based on the words we wanted for our brand we chose a color )</p>

No interacting with them. I carefully watched the naturally occurring behavior without letting the subjects know they
 were observed. 
It also served the purpose of supporting external validity the research as the finings that I observed, occurred in the

                                    <p>This type of interviews were conducted at the user's environment (gym). 
                                        This method allowed me to access people's experiences and feelings; it generated data with different patterns.
                                        This data was analyzed using a grounded theorem approach. 
                                        My goal as a researcher was to understand the language and culture of the interviewee's from the interviewee's 
                                        perspectives.

                                    <p>This type of interviews  were conducted to gather focused, qualitative textual data. I used the following.
                                       Guidelines for question development; Style; Used open-ended questions. Biases, voiding leading questions. 
                                      Language,used terms that participants can understand, given their knowledge, language skills, cultural background,
                                      age, gender, etc. I tried to be mindful of the social or culture of my questions. 
                                      Concise, Kept the questions short and specific. 
                                      Frame, avoided questions with a positive or negative association.
